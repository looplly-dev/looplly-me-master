# Netlify Environment Variables Configuration
# 
# Add these environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:
# Site Settings → Environment Variables
#
# These are the ONLY variables needed for Netlify deployment
# All other configuration will be loaded from Supabase

# REQUIRED: Core Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# OPTIONAL: Build Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# NOTE: All other configuration values (analytics, debug flags, timeouts, etc.)
# are now stored securely in the Supabase app_secrets table and loaded dynamically.
# This reduces the need to manage environment variables in Netlify.
