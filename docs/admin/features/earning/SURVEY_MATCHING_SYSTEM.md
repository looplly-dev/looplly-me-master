# Survey Matching System

## Overview

Looplly uses an AI-powered survey matching system to connect you with surveys you're most likely to qualify for. Understanding how this system works helps you get more survey invitations and earn more money.

---

## How Matching Works

### The Matching Algorithm

When a survey becomes available, the system:

1. **Analyzes Survey Requirements**
   - Target demographics (age, gender, location)
   - Specific interests or behaviors
   - Required profile completion level
   - Quota needs (how many responses needed)

2. **Evaluates Your Profile**
   - Profile completion level (1, 2, or 3)
   - Demographic match (age, gender, location)
   - Interest alignment (from profile data)
   - Historical performance (quality score)

3. **Calculates Match Score**
   - Perfect match: 90-100% (almost guaranteed invitation)
   - Good match: 70-89% (likely invitation)
   - Fair match: 50-69% (possible invitation if spots available)
   - Poor match: Below 50% (rarely invited)

4. **Prioritizes Invitations**
   - Highest match scores get first priority
   - Profile quality affects ranking
   - Recent activity boosts your score
   - Reputation/streak multipliers apply

5. **Sends Survey Invitation**
   - Appears in your Earn tab
   - Shows estimated payout and duration
   - Limited spots (first come, first served)

## Understanding Disqualifications

### Why You Get Screened Out

**Common Reasons**:

1. **Quota Filled**
   - Survey needed 100 males age 25-34
   - Quota met while you were answering
   - Not your fault, try next time

2. **Profile Mismatch**
   - Your profile doesn't match survey requirements
   - System thought you might qualify, but didn't
   - Refine profile accuracy

3. **Demographic Cutoff**
   - Survey needs very specific demo (e.g., "owns 2+ cars")
   - You don't meet criteria
   - Normal and expected

4. **Quality Flags**
   - Inconsistent screening answers
   - Rushed through too fast
   - Improve survey quality

5. **Regional Restriction**
   - Survey limited to specific cities/regions
   - You're outside target area
   - Can't be changed

### Reducing Disqualification Rate

**Target Disqualification Rate**: 20-30% (unavoidable)

**If Above 50%**:
✅ Review profile accuracy (most common issue)
✅ Answer screening questions honestly
✅ Complete Level 2 or 3 profile
✅ Check your quality score
✅ Don't try to "game" screening questions

**Normal to Be Disqualified Sometimes**: Even perfect profiles get screened out 20-30% of the time due to quotas and specific requirements.

1. ❌ Level 1 profile (only basic demos)

### "I qualified for a survey but it disappeared"

**Reasons**:
- ✅ Quota filled while you were answering screening
