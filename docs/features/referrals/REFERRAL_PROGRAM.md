# Referral Program Guide

## Overview

Earn **$0.35 for each friend** who joins Looplly using your referral code and qualifies by earning their first $0.35. There's **no limit** to how many friends you can refer, making this a powerful way to boost your income.

---

## How It Works

### The Qualification Process

```
You Share Referral Code
         ↓
Friend Uses Code to Sign Up
         ↓
Friend Completes Registration
         ↓
Friend Earns $0.35+ on Platform
         ↓
AI Verification (24-48 hours)
         ↓
YOU Earn $0.35 Bonus ✅
```

**Key Point**: Your friend must **earn $0.35 on their own** before you get your bonus. This ensures they're active users, not just signups.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Find Your Referral Code

1. Open Looplly app
2. Go to **"Refer"** tab in dashboard
3. Find your unique code (e.g., `JOHN1234` or `SARAH789`)
4. Copy code or share link

---

### Step 2: Share With Friends

**Multiple Sharing Options**:

#### Direct Link
```
https://looplly.com/join?ref=YOUR_CODE
```
- Automatically applies your code
- Friend just clicks and signs up
- Easiest method

#### Referral Code Only
```
YOUR_CODE (e.g., JOHN1234)
```
- Friend enters during registration
- Manual entry required
- Works if link doesn't

#### Share via App
- WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter integration
- Pre-written message included
- One-tap sharing

---

### Step 3: Track Your Referrals

**Referral Dashboard Shows**:
- **Total Referrals**: Everyone who used your code
- **Pending**: Signed up, haven't qualified yet
- **Qualified**: Earned $0.35+, you got paid
- **Earnings**: Total referral income

**Example Dashboard**:
```
Total Referrals: 15
Pending: 3 (still working on earning $0.35)
Qualified: 12 (you earned $4.20 total)
Success Rate: 80%
```

---

## Qualification Requirements

### What Your Referral Must Do

Your friend qualifies when they:
1. ✅ Sign up using your code
2. ✅ Complete registration (email, password, basic profile)
3. ✅ Verify mobile number
4. ✅ Earn $0.35+ through any activity:
   - Complete 1 survey ($0.50+), OR
   - Watch 7-10 videos ($0.35), OR
   - Complete 3-5 tasks ($0.35+), OR
   - Combination of activities totaling $0.35+

### What Doesn't Count

---

4. Bonus clears to Available Balance: 24-48 hours
5. You can withdraw: As soon as in Available Balance

**Total**: 3-5 days from friend qualifying to your withdrawal

---

### Bonus Amount

**Standard Bonus**: $0.35 per qualified referral

**Future Enhancements** (Coming Soon):
- Tiered bonuses for high-volume referrers
- Extra bonuses for highly engaged referrals

You mentioned wanting to save up for [specific goal]. I found this app 
called Looplly that's helped me make an extra $50-80/month doing surveys 
and watching videos.

It's not going to replace your job or anything, but it's nice supplemental 
income for ~1 hour/day. Plus it's flexible - I do it during my commute 
or while watching TV.

Thought you might be interested. If so, here's my referral link:
[Link]

I get a small bonus if you try it out and earn your first $0.35 (takes 
about 30-60 minutes). Let me know if you have questions - happy to help 
you get started!

[Your Name]
```

## Common Questions

---

### "What if my friend doesn't qualify?"

**Normal**: 30-50% of signups never qualify (typical drop-off).

**Reasons**:
- Lost interest
- Too busy
- Didn't understand how to earn
- Unrealistic expectations
- Technical issues

**What You Can Do**:
- Follow up after 2-3 days
- Offer help getting started
- Share tips for earning quickly
- But don't be pushy (some people just won't engage)

**Accept**: Not everyone will qualify, focus on volume + support.

---

### "Can I refer myself or family members?"

**Same Household**:
✅ **Allowed**: Refer family members (spouse, siblings, etc.)
❌ **Not Allowed**: Multiple accounts for same person
