## Common Questions

**Q: If I complete Level 3, will I get surveys every day?**
A: Survey availability depends on multiple factors (your profile, reputation, current demand). Level 3 ensures you qualify for the maximum available surveys, but availability varies by country and season.

**Q: Can I skip Level 2 and go straight to Level 3?**
A: No, profiling is progressive. You must complete Level 1 before Level 2, and Level 2 before Level 3.

**Q: Does refreshing stale data really increase earnings?**
A: Yes. Fresh profiles get priority for survey distribution and have higher match rates. Stale profiles can see 30-60% fewer invitations.

**Q: How often should I update my profile?**
A: Update whenever your circumstances change and when you receive staleness notifications. Most users update major sections every 3-6 months.

**Q: What if I don't want to answer certain Level 3 questions?**
A: Level 3 is optional. You can skip questions or entire categories, but incomplete Level 3 limits access to some premium surveys.

**Q: Do I get paid for completing my profile?**
A: You earn reputation points (not cash) for profile completion. These points increase your reputation tier, which provides earning multipliers on surveys.
