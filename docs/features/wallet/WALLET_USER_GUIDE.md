# Wallet User Guide

## Overview

Your Looplly wallet is the central hub for managing all your earnings. This guide covers everything you need to know about viewing balances, understanding transaction history, and withdrawing your hard-earned money.

## Understanding Your Balance

### Balance Types

Your wallet displays two key balance types:

#### **Available Balance**
- Money you can withdraw **right now**
- Already verified and cleared by our AI Accountant
- Ready for cash-out to your preferred method
- Displayed prominently at the top of your wallet

#### **Pending Balance**
- Money currently being verified
- Recent earnings that need AI verification (typically 24-48 hours)
- Includes transactions marked as "Verifying" or "Awaiting Funds"
- Automatically moves to Available Balance once verified

**Example:**
```
Available Balance: $15.35 ← Withdraw anytime
Pending Balance: $3.20 ← Being verified
Total Earned: $18.55
```

## AI Accountant System

### What is The Accountant?

The Accountant is our AI-powered transaction verification system that:
- ✅ Verifies all incoming earnings are legitimate
- ✅ Detects and prevents fraudulent activity
- ✅ Approves cash-out requests after security checks
- ✅ Protects your account from unauthorized transactions

### Why Verification Takes Time

**Incoming Earnings (24-48 hours):**
- Confirms survey/task completion with providers
- Validates reward amounts match activity
- Checks for duplicate or fraudulent submissions
- Ensures funds are actually received from partners

**Outgoing Withdrawals (2-4 hours):**
- Verifies account ownership
- Checks withdrawal destination matches your profile
- Confirms sufficient Available Balance
- Prevents unauthorized access attempts

**Note**: Verification times are maximum estimates. Most transactions clear much faster.
