## What Is Your Looplly Profile?

Your profile is **the key to unlocking better surveys and higher earnings**. The more we know about you, the better we can match you with surveys you'll actually qualify for—saving you time and frustration.

---

## Why Your Profile Matters

### 🎯 Better Survey Matches
When your profile is complete and up-to-date, you'll see:
- More relevant surveys
- Higher completion rates (less screening out)
- Surveys tailored to your interests and demographics

### 💰 Higher Earnings
Advertisers pay **30-50% more** for users with detailed, fresh profiles because the data is more valuable.

### ⚡ Faster Access
Complete profiles unlock earning opportunities immediately—no need to answer the same questions in every survey.

---

## The 3 Profile Levels

### Level 1: What You Told Us at Signup
**5 Questions (Required)**
- First Name
- Last Name
- Mobile Number
- Email Address
- Home Address (verified via Google Places)

**Why We Ask**: These are essential for account creation, fraud prevention, and location-based surveys.

**When You Answer**: During signup (one-time only)

---

### Level 2: Essential Info to Unlock Earning
**10-15 Questions (Required Before Earning)**
- Gender
- Date of Birth
- Household Income (currency-specific to your country)
- Socioeconomic Classification (SEC/SEM/NCCS depending on country)
- Ethnicity
- Employment Status

**Why We Ask**: These are **core demographic fields** that every survey requires for targeting. Without them, we can't match you with surveys.

**When You Answer**: Before you can access the "Earn" tab

**What Happens If You Don't**: You'll see a banner: _"Complete Your Profile to Start Earning"_ and the Earn tab will be locked.

---

### Level 3: Optional Details for Better Matches
**20-40 Questions (Optional, Contextual)**
- **Employment**: Industry, job title, workplace size, skills
- **Lifestyle**: Hobbies, interests, media consumption, fitness habits
- **Automotive**: Car ownership, brand preference, purchase timeline

- **Health**: Health insurance, fitness habits, diet
- **Finance**: Banking habits, credit cards, investment experience
- **Shopping**: Brand loyalty, shopping habits, price sensitivity
- **Family**: Marital status, children, pets, household size

**Why We Ask**: These help us match you with **higher-paying, specialized surveys** (e.g., car buyers research, tech product testing).

**When You Answer**: 
- When you click on a specific survey category (e.g., "Before viewing this automotive survey, answer 3 questions about car ownership")
- After completing milestones (e.g., "Congrats on 5 surveys! Answer 5 employment questions to unlock higher-paying opportunities")
- Over time as gentle prompts (e.g., "You've been with us for 7 days! Answer 5 lifestyle questions for better matches")

**Can You Skip**: Yes! Level 3 questions are optional. But skipping means:
- You'll see fewer surveys in that category
- Lower-paying surveys (generic, not specialized)
- More time spent in survey screeners

## Why Profile Data Expires

### Life Changes
Your profile data doesn't stay accurate forever:
- **Income changes**: New job, raise, promotion, job loss
- **Lifestyle changes**: New car, moved house, got married, had kids
- **Shopping habits**: New brands you like, preferences shift
- **Technology**: Upgraded devices, switched phones

### Keeping Survey Matching Accurate
If your data is outdated:
- Surveys won't match your current situation
- You'll screen out more often (wasting time)
- Earnings drop because completion rates are lower

### Advertisers Demand Fresh Data
Survey clients pay 50-70% more for users with data refreshed within the last 90 days. Stale data = lower CPM = lower earnings for you.

---

## Data Expiry Intervals

| Type of Question | Expires After | Examples |
|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Never Expires** | Immutable | Date of Birth, Gender, Address |
| **Annually** | 365 days | Lifestyle, hobbies, interests |
| **Biannually** | 180 days | Income, job title, housing |
| **Quarterly** | 90 days | Brands, shopping habits, device ownership |
